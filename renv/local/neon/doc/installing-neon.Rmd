This quick start guide provides a fast reference for installing `neon`.

We assume that you have installed both [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/) and [`RStudio`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). If not, please go and do that now.

*Note: If you have already installed `neon` you can skip this article!*

Typically, you would install a package via CRAN or github, but in order to ensure only Smartabase customers get access to `neon`, you will have been provided the package in the form of a .zip file for Windows or .tgz file for Mac.

### Installing dependencies

When installing a package from a .zip or .tgz, R does not automatically install the packages that `neon` depends on (as it would when downloading from CRAN / github), so you must install them manually. Run the code below to install the dependencies

```{r dependencies, eval = FALSE}
# List of packages that need to be installed for neon to work
neon_dependencies <- c("httr", "readr", "getPass", "dplyr", "tibble", "tidyr", 
                    "purrr", "jsonlite", "stringr", "magrittr", "lubridate", 
                    "rlang", "tidyselect", "usethis")

# Packages from above list that are not already installed on your local machine
new_packages <- neon_dependencies[!(neon_dependencies %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"])]

# Install the packages
if (length(new.packages) & !identical(new_packages, character(0))) {
  install.packages(new_packages)
}
```

### Installing neon

If you are using RStudio, the easiest way to install `neon` is via Tools --> Install Packages. See the gif below

```{r install_gif, echo = FALSE, out.extra = 'style="border:0;"', out.width = "700px"}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/installing_gif.gif")
```

Otherwise, run the code below -- ensuring that neon.zip is in your working directory (replace 'neon.zip' with 'neon.tgz' if on a Mac):

```{r install_path1, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("neon.zip", repos = NULL, type = "binary")
```

The `neon` package should now be installed in your R packages library.

Please see the `getting-started` vignette for some basic info on how to get up and running with `neon`
