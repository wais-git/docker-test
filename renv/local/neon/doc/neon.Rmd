The neon package serves as an R wrapper for the Smartabase API. At present, the package consists of two primary functions: `pull_smartabase()` for downloading Smartabase data into R and `push_smartabase()` for uploading data from R up to Smartabase.

### Installation and getting started
To install `neon` - please read the "Installing neon" vignette (`vignette(installing-neon, package = "neon")`) or contact your Smartabase builder.

### Usage
The two main functions of `neon` allow you to push and pull data from your Smartabase site via the Smartabase API. Read the "Pulling Data: A Detailed Guide" vignette (`vignette(pulling-data, package = "neon")`) and the "Pushing Data: A Detailed Guide" vignette (`vignette(pushing-data, package = "neon")`) for more details.

#### pull_smartabase()
The pull smartabase function allows you to pull data from a specific Smartabase  event form. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
data <- pull_smartabase(
  url        = "example.smartabase.com/neon",
  form       = "Daily Wellness",
  username   = "john.smith",
  start_date = "01/01/2019",
  end_date   = "01/02/2019"
)
```

#### push_smartabase()
The push smartabase function allows you to send data back to a Smartabase form. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
push_smartabase(
  df       = data,
  url      = "example.smartabase.com/neon",
  form     = "Daily Wellness",
  username = "john.smith"
)
```
